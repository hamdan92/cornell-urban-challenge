# Introduction #

The Path Smoother uses a non-linear optimization toolkit titled LOQO.


# Details #

LOQO is not free software, so we cannot post a copy of the license we use to run the code. They do offer a free trial and a heavily reduced cost to academics. Please visit their website at http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/loqo/LOQO.html

Note, you can simply use their LOQO username and password for the trial with our software while evaluating the Path Smoother. However, you must get these files directly from the LOQO website.
